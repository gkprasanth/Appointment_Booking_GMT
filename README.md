# Appointment Booking Web Application

This web application allows users to schedule appointments with consultants. It provides user-facing features for booking appointments and consultant-facing features for managing availability. The application is built using the following technology stack:

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS
- React

### Backend
- Node.js

### Booking

- Users can select an available time slot and book an appointment with a consultant.

### Confirmation Email

- Upon booking confirmation, the application sends an email to the user confirming the appointment details.

### Google Calendar Integration

- An event is automatically created in the consultant's Google Calendar upon successful booking, and the user is added as a guest to the event to receive event notifications.
